This module creates a variable number of blocks. Each block displays either a place or subject tree from a customizable starting point
where each node of the tree shows the number of a specific type of resource tagged with that kmap. In the block configuration, you choose
the type (places/subjects), the root node, and the type of resource to display counts for (e.g. A/V, texts, etc.). The block then dispalys
that portion of the tree with numbers indicating the number of resources of chosen type tagged with that kmap.
